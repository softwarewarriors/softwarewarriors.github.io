Task Jeeves is a Meteor application that illustrates:

  * A secure web application deployment using Microsoft's Security Development Lifecycle.
  * A task management system that allows users to create tasks for productivity purposes.
  * Allows creating new tasks with due dates.
  * Allows marking tasks as complete.

The goal of this application is to demonstrate a Meteor development providing a secure directory structure for development and deployment, a set of common extensions to the core framework, and a basic application to implement basic page display, navigation, forms, roles, and collection manipulation.
